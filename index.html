                <p>We all know how important sports and recreation are in developing children's skills for a brighter future.
                    At our current project in Mozambique, Africa, it started with a simple soccer ball. Soon thereafter that gift
                    of a ball grew to team uniforms and organized competition. Today our goal is to replace a dusty dirty soccer
                    ground to a beautiful green, grass field.</p>
                <p>To the community of Pambara, it’s more than just a soccer field. It’s a field of dreams. A place where kids can
                    practice, play, learn, grow and develop into future leaders.</p>
                <p class="bold">Please help us make their “field of dreams” a reality.</p>
                <p>All children deserve the opportunity to compete in team sports, experience the pride of donning a new uniform and
                    enjoy the pleasures healthy recreation provides. But we need your help to make those things happen for the children
                    of Pambara, Mozambique.</p>

                    <p>After traveling the world and seeing the tremendous amount of families in need, Michael and Susan Ellison founded
                        The House of Giving, a 501 (c) (3) non-profit organization that receives tax-deductible donations to fund wellness
                        research, education and a variety of life-sustaining amenities.</p>
                    <p>For nearly two decades, we’ve been providing clean water, basic nutrition and education to those less fortunate.
                        In 2015 while implementing our nutrition and water programs, we saw the opportunity to introduce team sports into
                        our education programs to further encourage kids to play together, stay in school together and promote healthy,
                        active lifestyles. </p>
